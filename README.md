# University Rankings Analysis
ECE 143 Final project - Group 11
This project compares different university ranking systems and the changing trends in rankings over the years. University rankings, though controversial, are very important for prospective undergraduate and graduate students to help choose the university which would be a good fit for them. This project tries to address the following questions:
*Are all the ranking systems consistent? 
*Would expenditure affect ranking?
*Which countries have the top-ranked universities and how does it change over time?

# Data
All the data we used is stored in the [data](./data) folder. This data is mostly from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings?select=educational_attainment_supplementary_data.csv). Some supplementary education expenditure data was obtained from [UNESCO](http://data.uis.unesco.org/#).
