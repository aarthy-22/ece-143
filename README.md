# University Rankings Analysis
ECE 143 Final project - Group 11
This project compares different university ranking systems and the changing trends in rankings over the years.
# Data
All the data we used is stored in the [data](./data) folder. This data is mostly from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings?select=educational_attainment_supplementary_data.csv). Some supplementary education expenditure data was obtained from [UNESCO](http://data.uis.unesco.org/#).
